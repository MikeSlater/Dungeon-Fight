# Dungeon-Fight
A fun, text based math game I made for my kids as my very first attempt at programming in C#.

Players enter their name, then get to choose a math type (addition, subtraction, multiplication) that they will use to fight monsters. The numbers are randomly generated between 0-10 and the player must answer a total of 17 correct questions to win the dungeon. As the player progresses through the monsters, the monsters get more HP and deal more damage.

I wrote this for my 5 and 9 year old kids, but you're free to tweak it as you see fit to adjust it for your kids (or yourself, if you want, I don't judge)

If you have any feedback, let me know! I won't turn down ideas to improve the code!
